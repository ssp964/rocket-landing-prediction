# Rocket Landing Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage landings using historical data. By applying various data science and machine learning techniques, we analyze launch data to build models capable of predicting landing outcomes, contributing to cost-effective space exploration.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection:** API-based data retrieval for SpaceX launches.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data wrangling and visualization to uncover insights.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Built models to predict landing success, including logistic regression.
- **Visualization:** Dash-powered web dashboard for interactive data exploration.

## Folder Structure
- **Data/**: Contains datasets used in this project.
- **Dashboard.py**: Python file for the Dash dashboard.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data collection, wrangling, and model development.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssp964/rocket-landing-prediction.git
